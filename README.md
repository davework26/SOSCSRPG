# WPF RPG

I completed the WPF & C# tutorial here: https://soscsrpg.com/ to learn the basics of WPF by programming a simple role-playing game.
In the game, a character is generated with statistics that are used in combat against creatures as you move between locations using navigation buttons. You also have an inventory of weapons and consumables.
